# AI ALARM
This project is an AI-powered alarm system that uses a camera to detect if you have actually awoken from sleep. The system is written in JavaScript and can be accessed through a website where you can set, modify, and stop alarms. One of the unique features of this system is its ability to determine the optimal time for you to wake up based on your sleep cycles.

But what are sleep cycles and how do they factor into this system? Sleep cycles refer to the stages of sleep that our bodies naturally go through as we rest. These cycles include stages of light sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Each cycle typically lasts for 90-110 minutes and it is believed that we go through multiple cycles during a single night's sleep.

The AI alarm system is able to determine the best time to wake you up based on where you are in your sleep cycle. For example, if you are in a deep sleep, it may be more difficult for you to fully wake up and you may feel groggy and disoriented. On the other hand, if you are in a lighter stage of sleep, you may be able to more easily wake up and feel more alert. By determining where you are in your sleep cycle, the AI alarm can help you wake up feeling more rested and alert.

In addition to detecting your sleep cycles, the system also allows you to set multiple alarms, customize the sound and volume of the alarm, and receive notifications when it is time to go to bed in order to optimize your sleep. All of these features combine to create a powerful and convenient AI-powered alarm system that can help you wake up feeling your best.
